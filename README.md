In today's fast-paced world, consumers are becoming increasingly health-conscious, seeking transparency and detailed information about the nutritional content of their food. Fast food chains like McDonald's offer a diverse range of menu items that cater to varying tastes and dietary preferences. However, understanding the nutritional value of these items can be challenging for the average consumer.

# Problem:
Consumers lack a comprehensive, easy-to-understand, and visually engaging tool that provides detailed insights into the nutritional content of McDonald's India menu items. This gap in information can lead to uninformed dietary choices, potentially impacting overall health and well-being.

# Objective:
The goal of this project is to create an interactive Power BI dashboard, "McDonald's India Nutrition Unwrapped," that offers a transparent and detailed analysis of the nutritional values of McDonald's menu items available in India. The dashboard aims to help users make informed dietary decisions by providing critical nutritional information such as total calories, protein, fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, sugars, added sugars, and sodium content for each menu item.

# Key Features:

  1. Total Calories Consumed: Measure and visualize the total energy intake from all menu items.
  2. Total Sodium Consumed: Track the total sodium intake from all menu items.
  3. Average Protein Content: Calculate and display the average amount of protein per serving.
  4. Total Fat Consumed: Measure and visualize the total fat intake from all menu items.
  5. Top 10 High-Calorie Items: Identify and highlight the top 5 menu items with the highest calorie content.
  6. Items Exceeding Daily Sodium Limit: Show the count of menu items that exceed the recommended daily sodium intake.

By leveraging these features, the "McDonald's India Nutrition Unwrapped" dashboard empowers users to make healthier choices and better understand the nutritional content of their favorite McDonald's menu items. This project aims to contribute to the broader objective of promoting health awareness and informed dietary practices among consumers.
